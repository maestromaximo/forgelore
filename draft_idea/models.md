Okay, now. Consequently, what I want to do now is now that this is transcript, so it could be errors on the. Long grammatics, but um. You're smart enough to understand. What I want to say for this is take a look at the base project, the base ideation, right? So the main? Um, idea of what is supposed to project to be like, right, and what I want you to do now is? Think, think deeply and and figure it out. The architecture of the models, right, and the back end that we are going to need in order to bring this idea into action, right? And in order to give you a better understanding of what's necessary, I'll give you some of the uh of the use cases, right? Um, and the flows that we have to support for this project and then, from there, you would be able to. Accordingly, uh, create the models the views. Um. And I don't necessarily want you to stick. We Bend into the logic of the agents because we are going to do that in the next step. For now, I want to be able to have the structure, right? So what I want you to really, really think deeply is, what models basically are needed, right, and basically be able to make those models? Then, of course. Accordingly, the if necessary abuse or URLs to sustain, kind of like the new pages that we're gonna have for this areas, but the actual distance logic we can do in the next step, right? We're architecting, if anything, the structure of the of the project based on the main ideations that we have in how the flowworks that I will tell you. Basically, the main idea is. God. Now that we have the dashboard, right? The user is going to be able to kind of like a Kickstarter project in two ways, right? Um. First thing that we should be able to do is. Be able to start a project that just simply from an idea, so we would click create on click on create project right, and it creates a project for us, um, basically. Projects should be able to hold artifacts right and also make relations to literature. That's also important. We should also have a way to store literature. Um, that is external, right? That's like. External literature has to be its own, kind of like model. I think if you think that's right, please do what you know it's best. I'll tell you just ideas I have, and you refine, of course. Um, because obviously we will be doing literature review, and we want to be able to keep a reference. On to the papers. Keep a reference to the PDF. The text all like the relevant information from a literature so that we can just keep it in if we want to go back to it or if we want to read it locally. We should be able to if we want to hit the PDF. We should be able to do that. No, um? That's one thing in reason why. On the side menu, we have the literature aspects because we should be able. To. Basically search for literature, uh, within there, or better said. I think this literature aspect that we should have on the side menu, like when you click it. Yeah, you can search for literature, but the main thing is that you are ingesting it, right? So, we should have kind of like a library of of literature papers, right? Um, that, or papers that we either locally import, right? Because we should be able to locally import a paper, right? Be able to classify that, uh, well, ideally anything that shows up on on that literature review is a completed paper, even if we publish it locally. Like, if you upload it, that means that it's just. Get kind of like published and full, right? It's not in the print, but it's still fully done in terms of content, right? That shouldn't be. There shouldn't be a question, right, that that's yes or yes. Um, again, we should be able to explore. Uh, search through it. It's like a library, so we should model that. But going back to the main thing, the project right, a project needs to be able to hold. Quite a few artifacts, right? So, it's kind of like an overview of, hey, this is project I'm working on and holds reference to those artifacts and some metadata. As necessary. The main artifact that it has to kind of like hold to is. A paper. I think for now, it would be good. Flip it into a like singular, like a project, will have a paper. There is no, like, multiple papers aspect to this, um, it would be a project with a paper, and that paper obviously will start on a draft status or ideation status. So basically empty now. Workflow so that we can then model, right? Um, the idea is that the user when they start a project? They would be asked, hey, do you have something to start with, like, do you have a paper that you're already writing? Or do you want? Do you have an idea or a purpose, or or some information, right? Um, onto what we want this project to be. Remember, all of this has to be academic research or r d. Regardless, both of those falling to research, right. So, what is the like? Idea hypothesis that you're trying to do? What are you trying to prove basically like in like an abstract, basically, is what we should be looking for an abstract idea or a thesis right into what we are doing for this paper. In case they don't have a starting one, right? Both of those have to converge to the same kind of like model. Um. Just due to the fact that. Well, we have to work with the same object. It's just what input we have, right? Um, but thinking into the fact that they do not have a a paper to start with or a project to start with, I'm sorry, a paper. Um, they create the project and then. Provide the, uh, kind of like a main abstract and then theoretically don't do it yet. Pathetically, we would have an agent, right, just a, an llm, a generative service. That basically grabs the, uh, the information processed. I'm kind of like. Grades, then the paper object that we want to work on. Now, these papers, objects that we want to work on. Have to be flexible enough to be able to accommodate all the basic structure that a paper needs to have, right. Again, we will be tailoring it to scientifical research, so it will have an abstract it would have then likely another obstacle references. Good, right? Like we have to and aware another model, the uh paper, um, into models, ironically? So that we can then obviously map into it, right? Like, if we get an abstract? Um, or an idea. We can then get a automatic agent to just start kind of like pre-filling those as a draft, right? Obviously, we will also have. A main content section. For the paper. And now, this, I live to your discretion into what you think would likely be necessary or best. Um, because the the content of that? Well, basically, the um of the paper. Will be latex. That's, uh, that's a given. It will be latex. And just due. Fact that? Well, it's, uh, it's important, right? Italy took us ski into this. However, I'm not sure if we would also just do it markdown, right? Because, um. I can understand. It's important to have latex for scientifical research to write notations appropriately, right? But the markdown is easier, perhaps for a. Processing, like, it's an MVP, right? And we would also be able to kind of, like, call lakedeck on the spot or mark down for, um, likely latex, for processing formulas or anything of I kind, so maybe it just becomes a mix among the two. I'm not sure you're gonna have to figure that out the best way possible to recall we're running at the jungle project. Keep that into consideration, um? But likely will be latik. Maybe not writing in latex, but for the formulas, that's, that's my main concern, right? So, when we write this? Ideally, the paper is not formatted already because it's just a paper. We can then generate a format to it via a different pipeline that we will figure out later. So, maybe you consider that the paper is just just has to get written on a just a single like normal? With this. If it was a Google Docs with the exception that you should be able to. Be able to input graphs into it, be able to input. Formula, Etc, so it has to be. It's a little more complex, right? Um. However, this comes to the fact that if you model the paper, uh, model, and you're looking to content, maybe it's not. The smartest is to have a single. It would be good, I think, to have a single content field like raw content or something like that, and anytime that you save the paper, it looks into, like subsections, and like pre-fills it with the text. Using the content. Maybe is a list of unordered list. Or indexed list, or something like that? Of other models that are more General that allow us to kind of like, build block, like by block in a way or another, the. The content of the uh of the paper, like subdivided, right, like section. By section, it should be abstract, Etc now, this, Etc, this Etc, and then. I don't know, or maybe whatever is most useful, but it has to be simple. We have to be aware that the modeling for this part has to be simple because we will be doing a lot of stuff with it. So, it really has to be the most General and the most simplest, and maybe we can change it later. Another model that is important. Is another sub artifact that will be necessary for. The project, and that sub artifact in this case is a. Simulations, right? Uh, so simulations are very general, um. They will consist. And when I say simulations, they would be code based, right? So a simulation? Is something that does not necessarily go into the paper right away. Um, but its results and procedure me right, and upon the discretion of the writer. But a simulation should basically have some metadata describing. What is it that we're trying to do? It should be able to relate to a project relate to a paper, right? Um. Our project already has a relationship paper, right? So maybe just relate to our project and in the idea? Is that like the models that we're going to have as they work through a project, a thesis, or an abstract. Not necessarily will generate perfect simulations, but they will have to start exploring right hypotheses, and we'll go into that later. But as they as they explore hypotheses, right, they have to be able to generate. Simulations. In other words, we're sticking to python for this just for the MVP. They should be able to have, like, a code snippet for the simulation right and inputs, if any, outputs as well. Um, if any, and then a method to run it right to run this simulation, um? And then we grab the result basically. Out of that, like a standard way to be able to simulate a result. It has to all be mathematical. I do gotta tell you that or code. It could just be code. Um, and it runs in outward, and we should be able to have a general way of storing that out because the output may be a graph. The output may be a table, right? Or it may just be a single string or a number. We should be able to be acknowledged to that, as well as the input and the input and outputs could be. Many right. It doesn't have to be a single one, or it could be none as well. Consider that maybe the code does not need input. What does generate an output, right? Uh, generally, we will force, um. An output. Um, but generally the summer Force. Let's just we expect it to be always generated and output. But yeah, basically. And that's another artifact. Now, another one that's important. Another artifact, that's important, very important. It's almost key to the whole process. Is hypothesis, and we will keep them. We will keep them under this name, uh? Unless you think of a better one. Where hypotheses are basically ideas, right? When we have a project and we have a paper, right? A paper has a main direction, right? Like, the main idea, the abstract of what we want to do, but within the work of a paper or project. There are many ideas that take place or get enacted, right? So, for example. If you're doing a project investigating? Um, and this is a this is just a a kindergarten model of a project, but basically, you ask. Is there a relation between the temperature and the amount of birds on? Panda, right? And then you start making ideas like, oh, um, like an idea, could be to, and all those ideas have to be. Um. Just an idea, right? Um, like, an idea like, oh yeah, relation could be. This relation could be that right, like a hypothesis, right? And it should have this model at this one. I need you to think hard because I'm not able to think as much of it, but I should have good metadata as well. But as well, it should have some. Kind of like. Ability to write statistical or results or results to the hypotheses, because each hypothesis will have a result that will condemn it to be true or false or non-sufficient, like just those values, kind of like p-values, like, hey, I think this true, or I don't think this is true or I'm not sure, but should continue further, Etc. Is that with all the modeling that we do? In the literature that we have, and all of this, we should be able. To then give a main abstract and then iteratively just work through the process, kind of like a human of doing literature review. Looking at the paper? Making hypotheses or ideas? Testing upon those hypotheses or researching upon those hypotheses where maybe they are? Um, investigated, like someone investigated them. Gathering upon results or building processes, right? And then put it into a into to the paper if it relates, right? So, and if it does relate right, we write, we write, and then we check it's the paper. Good enough. Are all the hypothesis made? Do we need any more etc, etc, and it should be able to continue on until we get to the point where our abstract is satisfied, right? Because that's the main purpose. There could be more hypotheses, but the abstract is satisfied, and if it is, if there's no doubt about it, it's completely sure. Have a fully researched and build paper, and that's a awesome goal. We really should look forward to the red, so that's why I'm telling you. You have to now figure out the. Basically the modeling, uh, for this, because that's very much the most. One of the most important parts to the project is being able to model the data so that we can then just do the systems and work upon it.
