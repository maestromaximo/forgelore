 What I wanted to be is basically  A research. It's kind of like the word is assistant, but in terms of verbal experience, it should be able to replace the relative research. Uh, I kind of obviously the idea is not replaced, but if it is capable, then it can operate the job. Those two 10x, right? So? The core of the product.  Value proposition or not, even the value position. But the main idea? Is that it's supposed to be a? A system, right? That is basically capable. Of doing kind of like a GitHub pilot. Kind of like action, right? So? In other words, the. The ability to? Kind of like how softwork was able to be? Um, 10x, quite a bit because? Basically because of GitHub for pilot on this exact same fashion, but this time with clinical research, right? So the parameters? Being able to have? Again, for lack of a better work. Physical pilot that is capable of doing the academic research alongside the. Virtual academic persons, the professor, or whatever it is of this coin, right, and then? From there. They are able to. Um, kind of like, proceed, and I'll be more. I'll be more specific here just one second. So, basically, the main idea is of the following kinds. So, we think in terms of inputs and outputs. The output is always going to the final output at least. This. Productize research item. So basically. The final product for all of these for for the project would ideally be. A a full scientifical paper. Without a without a doubt. That's, uh, that's the best. I'll put that could come from this. And when I mean a or what I specifically mean when I say full centrifugal paper? Right, um, I don't mean necessarily and difficult. I mean research paper, right? So, whatever domain they're working on, it has to be crossed, um, domain, agnostic, right, and? They basically mean that. You can see that they were investigating a specific claim. The paper should. The output of it should be as if or if not better than if they had spent the actual allocated to spend doing the research paper, the scientist, or the researchers by themselves, right? Now in terms of input equals two ways. The main focus of the? Of the project is in the continuous kind of like a pilot assisted development, and that takes place within the. What is it called within? The kind of like dashboardish or like the the writer kind of thing, um? Reason is because? You can like this into consideration. Like, the idea is that if they have a paper they're writing. They could put it into the system, and then the system starts working its architecture. No stop, um? Reducing basically the? The full project, right? Like assisted with you, testing hypothesis, making simulations working alongside. However, he should not only be like a pilot. Many of those compilot items are by itself. It should also be capable of just simply. Um. Doing an attempt by itself and that actually starts as an input with an idea so. If you wanted to, you don't have a paper, but you want to start a paper. You could give the information the research, like everything that has to do with that paper. Of creation aspect itself. And it should be able to. Grab that. In do the bases of basically? Well, do the bases on. On on that on on being able to do the initial scope, initial paper writing, drafting all of that as to, um. Be able to basically of the. Well, the uh, the paper started so that we can then go into the compilot kind of like session or actually give it rains off and just let it run. In terms of input data for now, it would be nice to. Stick to. To made a search they like the full idea. Um, for the first step, I think it's good to just have archive. Be able to kind of, like, have that archive, like search methods, so that we can then use the open AI agents SDK to do this search accordingly. However. Would not refrain. From then, looking into nature or other. Journals that they might have. Licensed. Like the individual. However, um. That's. That's for later. At the first, at least, the. The initial MVP. I would be interested on just. Um, and just having the. Archive as our source per se or first source of. Like information because it has to have a good source of information. That's that goes without saying at all right, like it's necessary. And that. That's the case for this. And then. Um, aside from that. Also. Another important thing. Simulation capabilities, right? So any RND or research? Has to be capable of kind of like running simulations. I think that's. That goes without a say, um, thus, why? I think I, we should definitely just stick to python for the simulation capabilities of this, by the way, no need to go any deeper than just python for this. Um. But like numpy, side pie, or just a way to run code, um? Disease fittest should be considered. As one of the capabilities, the system should be able to. To inert or or have? And then, aside from those. Which I think those are the main ones. So basically, something that I should be perfect at doing is, um. Literature review. Without a doubt, it has to be perfect doing literature review, and then it has to be very good running with ideas which are technically hypotheses, right? Um, testing it and then basically doing the full scientific method to continue writing and finishing the paper in one way or another right. And, um, yeah, that's basically the idea behind this, uh, system.
